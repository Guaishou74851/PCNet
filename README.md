## 📝 Abstract

Recent years have witnessed the success of deep networks in compressed sensing (CS), which allows for a significant reduction in sampling cost and has gained growing attention since its inception. In this paper, we propose a new practical and compact network dubbed PCNet for general image CS. Specifically, in PCNet, a novel collaborative sampling operator is designed, which consists of a deep conditional filtering step and a dual-branch fast sampling step. The former learns an implicit representation of a linear transformation matrix into a few convolutions and first performs adaptive local filtering on the input image, while the latter then uses a discrete cosine transform and a scrambled block-diagonal Gaussian matrix to generate under-sampled measurements. Our PCNet is equipped with an enhanced proximal gradient descent algorithm-unrolled network for reconstruction. It offers flexibility, interpretability, and strong recovery performance for arbitrary sampling rates once trained. Additionally, we provide a deployment-oriented extraction scheme for single-pixel CS imaging systems, which allows for the convenient conversion of any linear sampling operator to its matrix form to be loaded onto hardware like digital micro-mirror devices. Extensive experiments on natural image CS, quantized CS, and self-supervised CS demonstrate the superior reconstruction accuracy and generalization ability of PCNet compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly for high-resolution images.

## 🔥 Train

Download the dataset of [Waterloo Exploration Database](https://kedema.org/project/exploration/index.html) and put the `pristine_images` directory (containing 4744 `.bmp` image files) into `./data`, then run the following command:

```
python train.py
```

The log and model files will be in `./log` and `./model`, respectively.
